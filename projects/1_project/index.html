To produce land cover mapping, there are two general methods of image classification for land cover studies, namely visual interpretation and digital classification (Rambaldi et al., 2006). Digital classification has the advantage of automating based on pixel values that represent an object. However, field data is needed as input in formulating a classification scheme along with an evaluation of the classified land cover. This study aims to make land cover maps in Lund Kommun by integrating machine learning classification algorithms and field information. The study area is located in Lund Municipality centered at approximately 13o 21’ 30” E and 55o 42’ 58” N. This region has a temperate climate and relatively flat topography. Additionally, the study area is characterized by agricultural fields and forests, with a small proportion of cover consisting of water bodies and built-up areas.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project1/1.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project1/4.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project1/3.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Field data collections were collected on April 21st 2023.

There is a significant difference in classification in deciduous forest and cropland between points A and B. Consulting the previous knowledge of the study area, the results from the multi-layer perceptron classification more closely resemble the reality that cropland is the predominant land cover class in the study area. Figure 8 represents the area’s extent of different land cover classes. It is clearly visible that cropland is the most dominant land cover class in the study area in all of the classification types. On the other hand, the water class covers the least portion of the area. Corine land cover has been used as a reference classification to compare the results. In MD classification, urban areas have been underestimated compared to Corine Land cover. Most of the urban areas and some croplands have been misclassified as deciduous and coniferous forests. Moreover, added together, the deciduous and coniferous forests made up more than half of the area (54.11%) of Lunds Kommun. In contrast, MLP classified all of the classes quite accurately. Cropland accounted for the vast majority of users, at 62.23%. Then deciduous forests accounted for 16.36% followed by coniferous and urban areas, 9.32 % and 8.76% respectively. The difference in the areas in every class type between Corine LC and MLP is comparatively very low and therefore the result of MLP is more valid. To evaluate the accuracy of both algorithms, we used the confusion matrices (Table 1-2). It is clear that MLP is more accurate than MD classification. Overall accuracy in MLP is 82%, which is far better than MD classification, which is 40.3%. Concerning to kappa index, for MD, the value of the kappa coefficient is 0.31, whereas in MLP is 0.72. It is already mentioned that we added NDVI as an input band because the overall accuracy of MD only using four bands was 40.3%. We tested the performance of NDVI in the MD classification and the overall accuracy increased to 56.1% and the kappa index increased to 0.38. The evaluation of this project is that the field data were collected by various groups. When examining the samples, problems were found such as the sample cover class was located on the edge of two different classes. In addition, remote sensing images used with fieldwork have a three years temporal difference (Figure 9). Therefore, it will be better to utilize remote sensing imagery, that has a closer acquisition time to the field data collection period. Therefore, the results of the classification and accuracy will be better. The use of supervised classification on Sentinel 2B imagery and field data can be utilized to map land cover in Lund Kommun. The MLP algorithm produces better results for mapping land cover in Lund Kommun, compared to the MD algorithm, which has significantly higher accuracy values. The Cropland class dominates the area in Lund Kommun, while the water class has the smallest coverage. Furthermore, the use of NDVI as the input band enables the model to distinguish vegetation features, thereby increasing the accuracy.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/5-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/5-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/project1/5-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project1/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/11-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/11-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/11-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these. </div> <p>The code is simple.
