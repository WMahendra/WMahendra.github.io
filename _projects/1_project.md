Land cover information plays an important role in various sectors as it can be used to describe the spatial distribution of objects on the land surface Satellite remote sensing has been used for decades to assist land cover mapping activities due to its capability to capture vast areas and constant repetition. To produce land cover mapping, there are two general methods of image classification for land cover studies, namely visual interpretation and digital classification (Rambaldi et al., 2006). Digital classification has the advantage of automating based on pixel values that represent an object. However, field data is needed as input in formulating a classification scheme along with an evaluation of the classified land cover. This study aims to make land cover maps in Lund Kommun by integrating machine learning classification algorithms and field information.
The study area is located in Lund Municipality centered at approximately 13o 21’ 30” E and 55o 42’ 58” N. This region has a temperate climate and relatively flat topography. Additionally, the study area is characterized by agricultural fields and forests, with a small proportion of cover consisting of water bodies and built-up areas.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
