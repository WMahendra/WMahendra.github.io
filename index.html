Prior to the move, I worked as a research assistant, studying the role of remote sensing and GIS followed by field assessment to monitor peatland ecosystem in Indonesia.</p> <p>My focus lies in landscape ecology and ecosystem science, particularly in tropical areas. I am intrigued, how do the dynamics of the surface influene the environmental quality? Moreover, what are the impact of disturbances (i.e. climate change, fire) on the ecosystem?. To address these questions, I use the integration between field measurements and remote sensing technologies to describe the phenomena spatially and temporally.</p> </body></html>
