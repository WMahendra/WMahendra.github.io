Currently pursuing M.Sc degree in Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation for Environmental Modelling and Monitoring at Lund University and University of Twente. Prior to the move, I worked as a research assistant, studying the role of remote sensing and GIS followed by field assessment to monitor Indonesian peatland ecosystem, using multi-level policies to assist its effectiveness and impact.  

My focus lies in landscape ecology and ecosystem science, particularly in tropical areas. It is intrigued, how do the changes and dynamics of the surface influene the environmental quality? Moreover, what are the impact of disturbances (i.e. climate change, fire) on the ecosystem?. To address these curiosities, the integration between field measurements and remote sensing technologies could be used to describe the phenomena spatially and temporally.
