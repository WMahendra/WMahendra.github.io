Currently pursuing M.Sc degree in Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation for Environmental Modelling and Monitoring at Lund University and University of Twente. My focus is on the utilization of time series remote sensing with radar technology for natural resource, especially in tropical areas. 

Prior to the move, I worked as a research assistant, studying the role of remote sensing and GIS to monitor Indonesian peatland ecosystem, integrated with multi-level policies.
