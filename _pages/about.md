Currently pursuing M.Sc degree in Geoinformation Science and Earth Observation for Environmental Modelling and Monitoring at Lund University and University of Twente. Prior to the move, I worked as a research assistant, studying the role of remote sensing and GIS followed by field assessment to monitor peatland ecosystem in Indonesia.

My focus lies in landscape ecology and ecosystem science, particularly in tropical areas. It is intrigued, how do the dynamics of the surface influene the environmental quality? Moreover, what are the impact of disturbances (i.e. climate change, fire) on the ecosystem?. To address these questions, I use the integration between field measurements and remote sensing technologies to describe the phenomena spatially and temporally.
